This posts presents thoughts on causal inference and survival analysis.

 population of observational units $$U$$ from a population $$U$$.  Associated with each sample $$u \in U$$ is a set of baseline covariates


## Binary outcome: simplest case ##


Suppose $$ (Y_0, Y_1) $$. In causal inference, the randomness comes from the pair beings a random sample drawn from the population.

The two distributions $$P_0$$ and $$P_1$$ are identifiable in the context of an RCT.  The question should be contrasts such as:

$$ \frac{\log P_1 (T \geq c)}{\log P_0 (T \geq c)} $$

Compact summaries can easily be reported for this quantity at a range of values of c.

## Causal inference without counterfactions ##

Hello Walter; isn't it great.
