  title={The pilgrim process},
  author={Dempsey, Walter and McCullagh, Peter},
  abstract={Pilgrim's monopoly is a probabilistic process giving rise to a non-negative sequence that is infinitely exchangeable, a natural model for time-to-event data. The one-dimensional marginal distributions are exponential. The rules are simple, the process is easy to generate sequentially, and a simple expression is available for both the joint density and the multivariate survivor function. There is a close connection with the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival distribution. Embedded within the process is an infinitely exchangeable ordered partition processes connected to Markov branching processes in neutral evolutionary theory. Some aspects of the process, such as the distribution of the number of blocks, can be investigated analytically and confirmed by simulation. By ignoring the order, the embedded process can be considered as an infinitely exchangeable partition process, shown to be closely related to the Chinese restaurant process. Further connection to the Indian buffet process is also provided. Thus we establish a previously unknown link between the well-known Kaplan-Meier estimator and the important Ewens sampling formula.},

@article{vital,
  title={Vital variables and survival processes},
  author={Dempsey, Walter and McCullagh, Peter},
  abstract={The focus of a survival study is partly on the distribution of survival times, and partly on the health or quality of life of patients while they live. Health varies over time, and survival is the most basic aspect of health, so the two aspects are closely intertwined. Depending on the nature of the study, a range of variables may be measured; some constant in time, others not; some regarded as responses, others as explanatory risk factors; some directly and personally health-related, others less directly so. This paper begins by classifying variables that may arise in such a setting, emphasizing in particular, the mathematical distinction between vital and non-vital variables. We examine also various types of probabilistic relationships that may exist among variables. Independent evolution is an asymmetric relation, which is intended to encapsulate the notion of one process driving the other; X is a driver of Y if X evolves independently of the history of Y. This concept arises in several places in the study of survival processes.},

 abstract = {There is a growing scientific interest in the use and development of just-in-time adaptive interventions in mobile health. These mobile interventions typically involve treatments, such as reminders, activity suggestions and motivational messages, delivered via notifications on a smartphone or a wearable to help users make healthy decisions in the moment. To be effective in influencing health, the combination of the right treatment and right delivery time is likely critical. A variety of prediction/detection algorithms have been developed with the goal of pinpointing the best delivery times. The best delivery times might be times of greatest risk and/or times at which the user might be most receptive to the treatment notifications. In addition, to avoid over burdening users, there is often a constraint on the number of treatments that should be provided per time interval (e.g., day or week). Yet there may be many more times at which the user is predicted or detected to be at risk and/or receptive. The goal then is to spread treatment uniformly across all of these times. In this paper, we introduce a method that spreads the treatment uniformly across the delivery times. This method can also be used to provide data for learning whether the treatments are effective at the delivery times. This work is motivated by our work on two mobile health studies, a smoking cessation study and a physical activity study.}

  abstract = 	 {An important mobile health (mHealth) task is the use of multimodal data, such as sensor streams and self-report, to construct interpretable time-to-event predictions of, for example, lapse to alcohol or illicit drug use. Interpretability of the prediction model is important for acceptance and adoption by domain scientists, enabling model outputs and parameters to inform theory and guide intervention design. Temporal latent state models are therefore attractive, and so we adopt the continuous time hidden Markov model (CT-HMM) due to its ability to describe irregular arrival times of event data. Standard CT-HMMs, however, are not specialized for predicting the time to a future event, the key variable for mHealth interventions. Also, standard emission models lack a sufficiently rich structure to describe multimodal data and incorporate domain knowledge. We present iSurvive, an extension of classical survival analysis to a CT-HMM. We present a parameter learning method for GLM emissions and survival model fitting, and present promising results on both synthetic data and an mHealth drug use dataset.}

  title={Survival models and health sequences},
  author={Dempsey, Walter and McCullagh, Peter},
  abstract={Survival studies often generate not only a survival time for each patient but also a sequence of health measurements at annual or semi-annual check-ups while the patient remains alive. Such a sequence of random length accompanied by a survival time is called a survival process. Robust health is ordinarily associated with longer survival, so the two parts of a survival process cannot be assumed independent. This paper is concerned with a general technique-reverse alignment-for constructing statistical models for survival processes, here termed revival models. A revival model is a regression model in the sense that it incorporates covariate and treatment effects into both the distribution of survival times and the joint distribution of health outcomes. The revival model also determines a conditional survival distribution given the observed history, which describes how the subsequent survival distribution is determined by the observed progression of health outcomes.},

  title={The stratified micro-randomized trial design: sample size considerations for testing nested causal effects of time-varying treatments},
  author={Dempsey, Walter and Liao, Peng and Kumar, Santosh and Murphy, Susan A.},
  abstract={Technological advancements in the field of mobile devices and wearable sensors have helped overcome obstacles in the delivery of care, making it possible to deliver behavioral treatments anytime and anywhere. Increasingly the delivery of these treatments is triggered by predictions of risk or engagement which may have been impacted by prior treatments. Furthermore the treatments are often designed to have an impact on individuals over a span of time during which subsequent treatments may be provided.
Here we discuss our work on the design of a mobile health smoking cessation experimental study in which two challenges arose. First the randomizations to treatment should occur at times of stress and second the outcome of interest accrues over a period that may include subsequent treatment. To address these challenges we develop the "stratified micro-randomized trial," in which each individual is randomized among treatments at times determined by predictions constructed from outcomes to prior treatment and with randomization probabilities depending on these outcomes. We define both conditional and marginal proximal treatment effects. Depending on the scientific goal these effects may be defined over a period of time during which subsequent treatments may be provided. We develop a primary analysis method and associated sample size formulae for testing these effects.},

  author={Dempsey, Walter and Oselio, Brandon and Hero, Alfred O.},
  abstract={Network data often arises via a series of structured interactions among a population of constituent elements. E-mail exchanges, for example, have a single sender followed by potentially multiple receivers. Scientific articles, on the other hand, may have multiple subject areas and multiple authors. We introduce hierarchical edge exchangeable models for the study of these structured interaction networks. In particular, we introduce the hierarchical vertex components model as a canonical example, which partially pools information via a latent, shared population-level distribution. Theoretical analysis and supporting simulations provide clear model interpretation, and establish global sparsity and power-law degree distribution. A computationally tractable Gibbs algorithm is derived. We demonstrate the model on both the Enron e-mail dataset and an ArXiv dataset, showing goodness of fit of the model via posterior predictive validation.},

  abstract={We consider exchangeable Markov multi-state survival processes -- temporal processes taking values over a state-space with at least one absorbing failure state that satisfy natural invariance properties of exchangeability and consistency under subsampling. The set of processes contains many well-known examples from health and epidemiology -- survival, illness-death, competing risk, and comorbidity processes; an extension leads to recurrent event processes. We characterize exchangeable Markov multi-state survival processes in both discrete and continuous time. Statistical considerations impose natural constraints on the space of models appropriate for applied work. In particular, we describe constraints arising from the notion of composable systems. We end with an application of the developed models to irregularly sampled and potentially censored multi-state survival data, developing a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior computation.},

  author={Crane, Harry and Dempsey, Walter},
  abstract={A relationally exchangeable structure is a random combinatorial structure whose law is invariant with respect to relabeling its relations, as opposed to its elements. Historically, exchangeable random set partitions have been the best known examples of relationally exchangeable structures, but the concept now arises more broadly when modeling interaction data in modern network analysis. Aside from exchangeable random partitions, instances of relational exchangeability include edge exchangeable random graphs and hypergraphs, path exchangeable processes, and a range of other network-like structures. We motivate the general theory of relational exchangeability, with special emphasis on the alternative perspective it provides and its benefits in certain applied probability problems. We then prove a de Finetti-type structure theorem for the general class of relationally exchangeable structures..},

  title={Edge exchangeable models for interaction networks},
  author={Crane, Harry and Dempsey, Walter},
  abstract={Many modern network datasets arise from processes of interactions in a population, such as phone calls, email exchanges, co-authorships, and professional collaborations. In such interaction networks, the edges comprise the fundamental statistical units, making a framework for edge-labeled networks more appropriate for statistical analysis. In this context, we initiate the study of edge exchangeable network models and explore its basic statistical properties. Several theoretical and practical features make edge exchangeable models better suited to many applications in network analysis than more common vertex-centric approaches. In particular, edge exchangeable models allow for sparse structure and power law degree distributions, both of which are widely observed empirical properties that cannot be handled naturally by more conventional approaches. Our discussion culminates in the Hollywood model, which we identify here as the canonical family of edge exchangeable distributions. The Hollywood model is computationally tractable, admits a clear interpretation, exhibits good theoretical properties, and performs reasonably well in estimation and prediction as we demonstrate on real network datasets. As a generalization of the Hollywood model, we further identify the vertex components model as a nonparametric subclass of models with a convenient stick breaking construction.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
