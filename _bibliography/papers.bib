  title={The stratified micro-randomized trial design: sample size considerations for testing nested causal effects of time-varying treatments},
  author={Dempsey, Walter and Liao, Peng and Kumar, Santosh and Murphy, Susan A.},
  abstract={Technological advancements in the field of mobile devices and wearable sensors have helped overcome obstacles in the delivery of care, making it possible to deliver behavioral treatments anytime and anywhere. Increasingly the delivery of these treatments is triggered by predictions of risk or engagement which may have been impacted by prior treatments. Furthermore the treatments are often designed to have an impact on individuals over a span of time during which subsequent treatments may be provided.
Here we discuss our work on the design of a mobile health smoking cessation experimental study in which two challenges arose. First the randomizations to treatment should occur at times of stress and second the outcome of interest accrues over a period that may include subsequent treatment. To address these challenges we develop the "stratified micro-randomized trial," in which each individual is randomized among treatments at times determined by predictions constructed from outcomes to prior treatment and with randomization probabilities depending on these outcomes. We define both conditional and marginal proximal treatment effects. Depending on the scientific goal these effects may be defined over a period of time during which subsequent treatments may be provided. We develop a primary analysis method and associated sample size formulae for testing these effects.},

  title={Hierarchical edge exchangeable models for structured interaction networks},
  author={Dempsey, Walter and Oselio, Brandon and Hero, Alfred O.},
  abstract={Network data often arises via a series of structured interactions among a population of constituent elements. E-mail exchanges, for example, have a single sender followed by potentially multiple receivers. Scientific articles, on the other hand, may have multiple subject areas and multiple authors. We introduce hierarchical edge exchangeable models for the study of these structured interaction networks. In particular, we introduce the hierarchical vertex components model as a canonical example, which partially pools information via a latent, shared population-level distribution. Theoretical analysis and supporting simulations provide clear model interpretation, and establish global sparsity and power-law degree distribution. A computationally tractable Gibbs algorithm is derived. We demonstrate the model on both the Enron e-mail dataset and an ArXiv dataset, showing goodness of fit of the model via posterior predictive validation.},

@article{multistate,
  title={Exchangeable, multi-state survival process},
  author={Dempsey, Walter},
  abstract={We consider exchangeable Markov multi-state survival processes -- temporal processes taking values over a state-space with at least one absorbing failure state that satisfy natural invariance properties of exchangeability and consistency under subsampling. The set of processes contains many well-known examples from health and epidemiology -- survival, illness-death, competing risk, and comorbidity processes; an extension leads to recurrent event processes. We characterize exchangeable Markov multi-state survival processes in both discrete and continuous time. Statistical considerations impose natural constraints on the space of models appropriate for applied work. In particular, we describe constraints arising from the notion of composable systems. We end with an application of the developed models to irregularly sampled and potentially censored multi-state survival data, developing a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior computation.},

@article{rele2,
  title={Relational Exchangeability},
  author={Crane, Harry and Dempsey, Walter},
  abstract={A relationally exchangeable structure is a random combinatorial structure whose law is invariant with respect to relabeling its relations, as opposed to its elements. Historically, exchangeable random set partitions have been the best known examples of relationally exchangeable structures, but the concept now arises more broadly when modeling interaction data in modern network analysis. Aside from exchangeable random partitions, instances of relational exchangeability include edge exchangeable random graphs and hypergraphs, path exchangeable processes, and a range of other network-like structures. We motivate the general theory of relational exchangeability, with special emphasis on the alternative perspective it provides and its benefits in certain applied probability problems. We then prove a de Finetti-type structure theorem for the general class of relationally exchangeable structures..},

  title={A framework for statistical network modeling},
  author={Crane, Harry and Dempsey, Walter},
  abstract={We discuss how sampling design, units, the observation mechanism, and other basic statistical notions figure into modern net- work data analysis. These considerations pose several new challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by extending or generalizing classical methods. Such challenges stem from the diverse scientific and statistical applications in which network data emerge. By revisit- ing these basic statistical considerations, we suggest a framework in which to develop theory and methods for network analysis in a way that accounts for both conceptual and practical challenges of network science. We then discuss how some well known model classes fit within this framework.},

  title={Edge exchangeable models for interaction networks},
  author={Crane, Harry and Dempsey, Walter},
  abstract={Many modern network datasets arise from processes of interactions in a population, such as phone calls, email exchanges, co-authorships, and professional collaborations. In such interaction networks, the edges comprise the fundamental statistical units, making a framework for edge-labeled networks more appropriate for statistical analysis. In this context, we initiate the study of edge exchangeable network models and explore its basic statistical properties. Several theoretical and practical features make edge exchangeable models better suited to many applications in network analysis than more common vertex-centric approaches. In particular, edge exchangeable models allow for sparse structure and power law degree distributions, both of which are widely observed empirical properties that cannot be handled naturally by more conventional approaches. Our discussion culminates in the Hollywood model, which we identify here as the canonical family of edge exchangeable distributions. The Hollywood model is computationally tractable, admits a clear interpretation, exhibits good theoretical properties, and performs reasonably well in estimation and prediction as we demonstrate on real network datasets. As a generalization of the Hollywood model, we further identify the vertex components model as a nonparametric subclass of models with a convenient stick breaking construction.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
