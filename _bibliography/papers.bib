  title={Edge exchangeable models for interaction networks},
  author={Crane, Harry and Dempsey, Walter},
  abstract={Many modern network datasets arise from processes of interactions in a population, such as phone calls, email exchanges, co-authorships, and professional collaborations. In such interaction networks, the edges comprise the fundamental statistical units, making a framework for edge-labeled networks more appropriate for statistical analysis. In this context, we initiate the study of edge exchangeable network models and explore its basic statistical properties. Several theoretical and practical features make edge exchangeable models better suited to many applications in network analysis than more common vertex-centric approaches. In particular, edge exchangeable models allow for sparse structure and power law degree distributions, both of which are widely observed empirical properties that cannot be handled naturally by more conventional approaches. Our discussion culminates in the Hollywood model, which we identify here as the canonical family of edge exchangeable distributions. The Hollywood model is computationally tractable, admits a clear interpretation, exhibits good theoretical properties, and performs reasonably well in estimation and prediction as we demonstrate on real network datasets. As a generalization of the Hollywood model, we further identify the vertex components model as a nonparametric subclass of models with a convenient stick breaking construction.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
