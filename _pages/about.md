Hi, my name's Walter.  My research focuses on `Statistical Methods for
Digital and Mobile Health`.  My current work involves three
complementary research themes: (1) experimental design and data
analytic methods to inform multi-stage decision making in health; (2)
statistical modeling of complex longitudinal and survival data; and
(3) statistical modeling of complex relational structures such as
interaction networks. In the coming years, I will continue to design
and apply novel statistical methodologies to make sense of complex
longitudinal, survival, and relational datasets. This work will inform
decision making in health by aiding in intervention evaluation and
development. Outside of my research, I enjoy exploring Ann Arbor
with my fiancee by taking our beagle on long walks around town and
attending UMS performances or shows at the Ark.  I'm also an avid
soccer fan and play way too much rec league soccer.

Prior to joining, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of
Statistics at Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu).  My fellowship was in the
[Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html)
under the supervision of
[Susan Murphy](people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). I received my PhD
in Statistics at the
[University of Chicago](http://galton.uchicago.edu) under the
supervision of [Peter McCullagh](http://galton.uchicago.edu/~pmcc/).
